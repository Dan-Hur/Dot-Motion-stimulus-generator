# Dot-Motion-stimulus-generator
A program that creates "dot motion" stimuli. In these stimuli there are two groups of moving dots for witch the size, motion patterns and speed can be determined.
There are three possible motion patterns: translational, rotational and random. The translating dots move coherently in one (determinable) direction. Rotating dots move coherently clockwise or counterclockwise. Random dots move in a translational motion where each dot moves in a different (random) direction.
This code includes GUI for ease of use. After adjusting the parameters, you can export a video with the set parameters. you can choose the quality, length and type of video for export.
